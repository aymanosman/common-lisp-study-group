* Getting Started

We will be using [[http://www.sbcl.org/][Steel Bank Common Lisp]], you can get it with Homebrew:

#+begin_src shell
brew install sbcl
#+end_src

Emacs is highly recommended, it has very powerful editing modes for Lisp (I recommend [[https://github.com/joaotavora/sly][sly]]).
If you are new to Emacs, I recommend [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]].

There is a usable extension for VS Code users, check it out [[https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/vscode-alive.html][here]].
