* Getting Started

We will be using [Steel Bank Common Lisp](http://www.sbcl.org/), you can get it with Homebrew:

```
brew install sbcl
```

Emacs is highly recommended, it has very powerful editing modes for Lisp (I recommend [sly](https://github.com/joaotavora/sly)).

If you are new to Emacs, I recommend [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs).
